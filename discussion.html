									<b>The ASAJ National Team Programme has two components, a National Squad and a National Team selected for competition. Selection of the National Squad will be based on the criteria outlined below. Selection of Teams for Competition will be based on the criteria determined by Council for the meet in question.<br>
									</b></font>
									<p><font size="1" face="Verdana">Members of the National Squad will not be automatically selected for Competition. All swimmers registered with the ASAJ who meet the citizenship/residence requirements of the meet in question will be considered for selection to a National Team for Competition.<br>
									<br>
									The program recognizes the importance of the swimmer's coach in the development process. As the National Squads will not workout together every day, each swimmer and his/her coach will be required to sign a commitment document that outlines the minimum level training and participation required.<br>
									<br>
									Each swimmer and coach must therefore ensure that the goals of the program are being met and will periodically be required to confirm this in writing. Honesty is essential and breaches of trust (by swimmer and/or coach) will result in suspension from the National Squad while the ASAJ Disciplinary Board reviews the case.<br>
									<br>
									Parents and Guardians have a significant role in the development of the swimmer. They are to ensure that every opportunity is provided for the swimmer's development. The parent/coach/swimmer relationship must be professionally managed by all. The ASAJ believes that competition at the highest level and excellent academic standards can be achieved if carefully managed.<br>
									</font>
									</p>
									<p><font size="1" face="Verdana">Worldwide, swimmers are renowned as excellent time managers, a key ingredient to success. Parents, coaches and swimmers who are concerned about their swimmers academic results should express their concerns to a National Coach.<br>
									<br>
									The National Squad will be divided into two (2) sections, a National Junior Squad and the National Squad. Initially the ASAJ's financial and human resources will be directed primarily at the National Squad. As the programme matures and resources become available, the National Junior Squad will receive additional attention. The squads will be managed to achieve the following:<br>
