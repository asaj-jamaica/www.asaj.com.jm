            ...Janelle Atkinson kicked off Jamaica’s 2002 Commonwealth Games
            campaign with a 9<sup>th</sup> place finish in the 200 M Freestyle
            while Angela Chuck swam a season best to finish 19<sup>th</sup>.
            Ramon James and Tamara Swaby both failed to qualify for the
            semifinals but swam season best times in the 50 M Back and 50 M
            Butterfly respectively.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">In the 200 M Free, Atkinson who is better known
            as a distance swimmer, got off to a good start and remained with the
            leaders throughout the race. At the 50 m mark, Atkinson touched 5<sup>th</sup>
            in 28.99 but pulled herself into 4<sup>th</sup> by the halfway mark.
            With 50 metres to go, she had passed Zimbabwe’s Mandy Leach to be
            third and made the turn in 1:31.14. The last 50 metres saw the top
            three swimmers fighting hard for a qualifying spot in the finals but
            at the finish Atkinson just missed the final spot touching in
            2:02.18, just 1 second behind England’s Karen Gregg who touched in
            2:01.18 and Australia’s Giaan Rooney (2:01.73). Atkinson is the 1<sup>st</sup>
            alternate for the final.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">The next qualifying heat, which proved to be
            the fastest of the event, found Jamaica’s Angela Chuck was up
            against top seed Elka Graham from Australia. In was England’s
            Karen Pickering, who fed on the noisy home crowd who stole the
            Australian’s thunder to finish with the fastest preliminary time
            of 2:00.89. Chuck touched 7<sup>th</sup> with a season best time of
            2:09.20.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">Ramon James got off to a good start in the 50
            Meter Backstroke surfacing just before the 15 metre mark with
            Australia’s Ethan Rolff. With less than 2 seconds separating the
            top seven swimmers, James timed 27.99 to finished 6<sup>th</sup> in
            the heat and 19<sup>th</sup> overall. His time was just .53 sec
            slower than the 16<sup>th</sup> place semifinal qualifying swim.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">In a very competitive 50 metre Butterfly event,
            Tamara Swaby missed qualifying for the semifinals by .8 sec. Swaby
            who is better known for swimming the longer distance Butterfly<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>event started slowly but got into her rhythm buy the 25 meter
            mark. She started gaining on the leaders, she ran out off pool and
            touched in 29.28 to finish 22<sup>nd</sup> overall.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">One other notable Caribbean result was Jeremy
            Knowles making the finals of the 200 M Butterfly. Swimming in heat
            two, Knowles found himself up against two Australian’s Heath
            Ramsey and Grant McGregor. Half way through the race, Knowles found
            himself in 4<sup>th</sup> but swam a fantastic final 100 metres to
            take the lead just before the final turn. In the last 50 metres,
            refused to relinquish his lead, touching in 2:00.31, the fourth
            fastest time going into the final.</p>
