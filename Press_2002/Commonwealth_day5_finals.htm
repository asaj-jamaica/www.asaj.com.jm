            <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">August 3, 2002…..Janelle
            Atkinson claimed Jamaica’s second Commonwealth Games swimming
            medal when she won the Bronze in the 400 M Freestyle. Just minutes
            later, the 4 X 100 Freestyle Relay team of Atkinson, Tamara Swaby,
            Mariana Chuck and Angela Chuck smashed the National Record by eight
            seconds.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">One day after winning her first Commonwealth
            Games medal, a Bronze in the 800 M Free, Atkinson climbed on the
            starting blocks for her favorite event, the 400 M Free. Seeded in
            lane two, Atkinson started with another excelent reaction time (.67
            seconds) and took the early lead. By 25 metres, however,
            Australia’s Elke Graham had edged in to the lead and after the
            first turn turn she was followed by England’s Rebecca Cooke and
            together slowed opened up a lead that Atkinson could not close in
            her last surge.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">With 60 metres to go, and in 5<sup>th</sup>
            place, Atkinson picked up the pace and passed Canada’s Jessica
            Deglau just before the 350 meter turn. Heading for the finish,
            Atkinson slowly closed in on the leaders and with 10 metres from the
            finish, eased passed a fading Amanda Pascoe (Australia) to claim the
            Bronze. Rebecca Cooke touched first to stop the clock at 4:09.49,
            Graham second in 4:11.47 and Atkinson third timing 4:13.24.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">In the last event of the evening, Jamaica’s
            Women’s 4 X 100 Freestyle relay team smashed the National Record
            of 4:04.76. Atkinson swam the first leg swimming a fast 57.70 and
            handed over to Tamara Swaby who despite coming down with the flu,
            swam a respectable 58.80 second leg. Mariana Chuck then swam the
            third leg in a spectacular 1:01.34 split time, well under her best
            100 M Free time of 1:05.91. Angela Chuck took over to swim the
            anchor leg and battled to close the gap on Wales who was just three
            seconds ahead. Wales held on and Chuck touched sixth in a new
            Jamaican National Record time of 3:56.54, a full eight seconds
            faster than the old record set in 1999 at the Pan American Games.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">Swaby’s illness has forced her to scratch
            from the 200 M Butterfly scheduled for tomorrow. A decision will be
            made on the 4 X 100 Medley Relay in the morning.<o:p>
