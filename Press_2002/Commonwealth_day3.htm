            <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">August 1, 2002….At the
            Commonwealth Games Jamaica had a good day in the Swimming Pool as
            Janelle Atkinson this morning qualified for final of the 800 M
            Freestyle when she swam 8:41.91, her fourth fastest time in that
            event. Tamara Swaby swam a personal best and new <font color="#FF0000"><b>National
            Record</b></font> time of 1:04.25 in the 100 M
            Butterfly but just failed to advance to the semifinals.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">In the 800 M Free, Atkinson’s goal was to
            qualify for the final but avoid lane 4 by not have the fastest time
            in the preliminaries. Atkinson was the fastest off the blocks with a
            .68 second reaction time and settled into an easy pace behind
            Australia’s Amanda Pascoe and England’s Nathelie Brown. Swimming
            1:03.43 for the first 100 metres, Atkinson then stuck to her race
            plan swimming a consistent 1:05 split time for each of the next six
            100 metres. By the 300 Metre mark, Brown began to tire and fell
            behind, leaving Atkinson and Pascoe to jockey for position for the
            top two positions. At the final turn, Atkinson and Pascoe were .17
            seconds apart and the two headed for the finish. With 15 metres to
            go Atkinson slowed to ensure that she finished second. Pascoe
            touched in 8:40.88 and is seeded second going into the final, which
            will be swum on Friday evening. In heat 2, England’s Rebecca Cooke
            seemed intent in making a statement left the field in her wake and
            swam a fast 8:33.31 to win the race and the top seed time in the
            final. The stage is now set for an intriguing battle in the final
            between three of the world’s top distance swimmers.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">Despite a personal best time in the 100 M
            Butterfly, Tamara Swaby was disappointed at not going below 1:04 and
            qualifying for the semifinals. She got of to a fast start and showed
            good form and speed in the first 50 metres. Approaching the turn in
            forth place, Swaby appeared to miscalculate her distance from the
            wall and lost momentum having to glide into the wall. She surfaced
            in 7<sup>th</sup> place, but despite a good finish she could not
            make up the distance needed to qualify for the semifinals. Swaby
            finished 18<sup>th</sup> overall and is the second alternate for the
            semifinals to be swum this evening. Australia’s Petria Thomas is
            the top seed going into the semifinals after she broke the
            Commonwealth Games record swimming a fast 58.45.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">All of the Jamaican swimmers are scheduled to
            compete tomorrow. Atkinson will compete in the 800 M finals
            scheduled for the evening session while in the morning preliminaries
            which start at 10:00 AM, Mariana Chuck will swim the 50 M
            Backstroke, Angela Chuck and Tamara Swaby the 50 M Free and Ramon
            James the 100 M Backstroke.</p>
