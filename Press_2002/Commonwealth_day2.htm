            ...Jamaica had a mixed day at the XVII Commonwealth Games Swimming
            Competition as Ramon James swam a personal best time in the 50 M
            Butterfly, while Angela Chuck and Mariana Chuck were just off their
            best times in the 100 Freestyle and 100 Backstyle respectively. Both
            of the Chuck girls just missed qualifying for the semifinals.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">In the first event of the session, Ramon James
            swam a personal best time of 26.70 in the 50 M Butterfly
            preliminaries. Despite finishing third in his heat, James placed 27<sup>th</sup>
            overall and did not advance. Australia’s Geoff Huegill leads the
            fastest 16 swimmers into the semifinals after setting the
            Commonwealth Games record of 24.10.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">Swimming in her first major international
            competition, a very nervous Mariana Chuck started the 100 M
            Backstroke hoping to improve her time and qualify for the
            evening’s semifinals. She went out fast and turned at the 50
            metres in 33.10, just a body length behind leader Sarah Price
            (Australia). After the turn, Chuck tired fast and fell behind the
            leaders, finishing seventh in 1:09.65, just off her personal best
            1:09.63. Chuck will be the first alternate for the semifinals, which
            will be held this evening. Price won the heat and is the top seed
            going into the semifinals with a new Commonwealth Games record time
            of 1:01.16.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">Angela Chuck was just .13 second off her
            personal best time in the 100 M Freestyle swimming 58.44 to place 19<sup>th</sup>
            overall. Chuck left the blocks with the 4<sup>th</sup> fastest
            reaction time (.74 sec) in the event and looked strong at the end of
            the first lap, turning 5<sup>th</sup> in 27.68. With 15 M to go,
            Leah Martingdale (Barbados) and Yeo Joscelin (Singapore), who had
            trailed Chuck to that point, eased past to push her into 7<sup>th</sup>
            place. Australia’s Jodie Henry swam the fastest time in the heats,
            swimming 55.79. The semifinals will be held this evening.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">Two Jamaican’s are scheduled to compete in
            preliminary events tomorrow morning. Janelle Atkinson will compete
            in the 800 M heats and should advance to the final. If she can swim
            at her best, Atkinson is fancied to be in the medal hunt when the
            final is swum on Friday evening. If the seed times are anything to
            go by, Tamara Swaby will have to lower her personal best time swim
            of 1:04.97 to advance to the finals of the 100 M Butterfly. She
            clearly has the potential to do so if she maintains the form shown
            in the 50 M Butterfly when she swam under 29.28 sec.</p>
