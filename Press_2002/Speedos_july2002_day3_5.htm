                <b>Day 3 Report</b><p>On the third day the pickings were slim 
                for the Jamaicans but the region's colours were flying high 
                through the efforts of the Bajan Bradley Ally. The 15 year old 
                added to his 200 backstroke win of 2:07.20 of the previous day 
                by winning the consolation finals in 4:37.57 a new age group and 
                national record beating his own standard of 4:38.40 set at 
                sectionals last year ,his splits for each 100 were 
                1:02.66,1:09.56,1:20.55 and 1:04.20. </p>
                <p>Alia Atkinson finished 127th in the 200 freestyle in 2;24.87 
                splits were 1:09.09 and 1:15.78. Jevon Atkinson was disqualified 
                In the 400 I.M. Allison Bardowell finished 58th in 5:31.39 
                splits 1:11.53 , 1:28.58, 1:37.35 ,and 1:13.93.</div>

                The relays proved to be much more successful for all Caribbean 
                athletes in the 200 meter medley relay Fort Lauderdale &quot;A&quot; 
                finished 8th in 2:05.64 aided by a swift 30.24 butterfly leg 
                from Allison Bardowell. Bradley Ally helped Fort Lauderdale (FLST) 
                &quot;B&quot; to second in a quick 28.07 the 2nd fastest backstroke leg of 
                the relay&nbsp; and a new&nbsp; age&nbsp; group record beating Nicky Neckles 
                28.88 standard set in June 1996. A great swim was seen by the 
                &quot;A&quot; team's Bryce Clough who recorded a 24.99 butterfly to help 
                them to&nbsp; a 1:46.71 win.<div>

&nbsp;<p><b>Day 4 Report</b></p>
                    <p>The Jamaican swimmers had another tough day at the pool 
                    with the best performance coming from Jevon Atkinson with a 
                    personal best in the 100 metre Backstroke. From a regional 
                    perspective Bradley Ally continues to be the star as he 
                    continued his assault on the record books for his country. 
                    Bradley completed the backstroke double when he took the 100 
                    backstroke in 58.68 beating&nbsp;A .Greener&nbsp;of Pine Crest by .31 
                    seconds for the gold (splits 28.47 ,30.21). Jevon did his PB 
                    of 1:02.61 to finish 19th in the consolation finals (splits 
                    31.55 ,31.75).</p>
                    <p>Bradley then competed in the 100 butterfly where in the 
                    prelims he had clocked 59.60 to make the consolation finals 
                    with splits of 28.06 and 31.54. In the consolation finals he 
                    uncorked an amazing swim. He split the the first 50 in 26.65 
                    a new age group and national record&nbsp; beating the 26.86 
                    set&nbsp;Cliff Gittens in Japan last year and completed the race 
                    in 30.33 to finish over 2 seconds of his nearest pursuer in 
                    56.98 another age and national record beating Damian 
                    Alleyne's 58.30 set at last year's Carifta and Paul Yelle 
                    57.36 standard done at the Olympics in Seoul South Korea in 
                    1988. Jevon Atkinson finished 62nd in 1:02.61 (splits 28.70 
                    and 33.91).</div>

                    Bradley then completed a great day by swimming the second 
                    leg on the 800 freestyle relay in 1:57.48 to help FLST &quot;A&quot; 
                    to a total time of 7:47.90 bettering the Senior Qualifying 
                    time of 7:53.79. For the women Allison Bardowell 
                    finished&nbsp;50th in the 100 backstroke in 1:13.06 (splits 
                    34.46,38.60). Nicky Cain finished 104th in&nbsp;1:19.80 (Splits

                      her best time which she equaled in the prelims and&nbsp;just 
                      missing Dawn's national mark of 27.99. Jevon also showed 
                      that he is in form by stopping the clock in the one lap 
                      sprint in 24.83 for a consolation finals win, also a
