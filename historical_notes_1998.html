											<font face="Verdana" size="1">1998 was a year of rebuilding for the Amateur Swimming Association of Jamaica. The new Council's first task was to refocus the attention of the swimming community and media back to the development of Jamaica's swimmers. Three new Clubs were registered: The Royal Swim Club, Negril Wave Runners and the Barracuda Swim Club.<br>
											<br>
											<b>Development Projects<br>
											</b><br>
											Officials and Coaches Clinics - In March 1998 ASCA Director Mr. Guy Edison conducted a clinic for more than 40 swimming coaches at Universiry of Technology. The clinic covered the ASCA levels 2, 3 and 4 schools. The Coaches received Certificates of Participation.<br>
											<br>
											Later, at the same venue, CCCAN President Mr. Orban Mendoza conducted an official's clinic for more than 30 participants. In September, with the assistance of the Sports Development Foundation, three swimming coaches attended the ASCA World Swim Coaches Conference in Atlanta. Training continues for persons running the Meet Manager Computer and Electronic Timer.<br>
											<b><br>
											Synchronized Swimming<br>
											</b><br>
											Significant progress was made by Coach Katherine Lym Sang and others to develop the Sport of Synchronized Swimming in Jamaica. In 1998 Jamaica's first Synchronized Swimming Club, Island Aquatics, was formed. Members performed during the opening ceremony of two swim meets.<br>
											<br>
											<b>Water Polo<br>
											</b><br>
											There was renewed interest in Water Polo. In October, the Water Polo Splash one-day competition attracted athletes in all age groups.<br>
											<br>
											</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#006400"><b>Competitions<br>
											</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
											<b>Local<br>
											</b><br>
											After the start of the new calendar in August, six swim meets were held ( 2 school and 4 club). The 'traditional' clubs, 'Y' Speedos and Tornadoes Swim Clubs and the Flying Fish Ambassadors, continue to take top honours. However significant progress is being made by swimmers from other clubs particularly the Blue Seal Swim Club and the Montego Bay All Stars. 11 year old Montegonian Raine Andrews, who trains in the sea, is one of the rising young stars.<br>
											<br>
											<b>International<br>
											</b><br>
											In 1998, Jamaican swimmers competed at CARIFTA in Trinidad, CISC in Barbados, the CAC Games in Venezuela and the Commonwealth Games held in Malaysia. The results from these meets were very encouraging as the National Team showed excellent sportsmanship, team spirit and competitive drive. The National Team placed higher in the final standings and won more medals than in recent years, a trend begun a few years ago.<br>
											<br>
											While all national team members performed credibly, special mention must be made of the members of the team for the CAC and Commonwealth Games. Janelle Atkinson, Lydia Gordon, Tamara Swaby and Angela Chuck were competing at the CAC level for the first time each had good performances. Janelle who was our sole representative at the Commonwealth Games went on the place 5th in the 800 M Final with a time of 8:51.54.<br>
