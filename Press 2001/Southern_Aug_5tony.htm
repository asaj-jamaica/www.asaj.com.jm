              The 2001 edition of the Southern Zone Championships (31st July to
              August 4) will have two Jamaicans representing the Florida Gold
              Coast All Stars in Adi Atkinson and his sister&nbsp;Alia. This
              swim meet represents the best of each Local Swimming Committee's
              (LSC) swimmers in the South of the United States so the quality of
              the swims as well as the swimmers is at a very high standard.&nbsp;
              <p>First up was Alia Atkinson who competed on the second day of
              the championships in the 100 metre Freestyle and the 50 metre Butterfly.
              She qualified&nbsp; for the final of the 100 M Freestyle in a time
              of 1:03.17 seeding 5th&nbsp; but missed further glory by missing
              the finals of the 50 M Butterfly by 24/100ths of a second in a
              time of 32.10. Later in the evening, in the finals of the 100 M
              Free, Alia bettered her time but it was only good enough for 8th
              place . She took the&nbsp; race out harder than the morning heats
              going 30.33 at the half way mark and bringing it home in 32.69 for
              a total time of 1:03.02.Still a fine performance for a young
              swimmer who has done tremendously well this summer.</p>
              <p>On the third day of competition Alia swum well to register a
              4th seeding going into the evening's finals of the 50 metre
              freestyle with a time of 29.07. She moved up a place to capture
              the Bronze later that evening in a time 28.33 just .10 sec. off
              her national record set at CCCAN earlier this summer. She would
              have to swum under 27.31 to beat Jule Smith and take the title.
              Her time also puts her under the consideration time (28.79) which
              USS uses to determine a top 16 in each group .
