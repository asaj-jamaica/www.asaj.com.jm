                      In the&nbsp;New England long course championships&nbsp;running
                      from the August 2 - 5, the lone Jamaican 'Dawn' Chuck
                      continues to do well swimming for the Ocean State Squid
                      Club. On the first day in the 200 M Individual Medley she
                      clocked 2:29.66 but missed the&nbsp;&quot;A&quot; finals
                      by .62 and scratched from the consolation finals. In the
                      100 metre freestyle Chuck made up for not making the&nbsp;&quot;A&quot;
                      finals in the I.M. by qualifying as the top seed in 58.35.&nbsp;She
                      returned in finals to grab the silver in a&nbsp;fast 58.31
                      out-touched by the winner&nbsp;Sally Brown by .07.&nbsp;
                      <p>In the 200 M Freestyle on Friday, &quot;Dawn&quot; swam
                      a swift 2:09.33 for 4th place going into the finals. In
                      the resulting final she could not improve her placing but
                      improved her time, swimming the first 100 over a second
                      faster than prelims in 1:02.43 (prelims1:03.95) and was
                      third at the turn . She could not hold off teamate Jean
                      Lee who had a&nbsp;stronger second half&nbsp;(split
                      1:05.81) who took the bronze in 2:08.52 to 2:08.55 by
                      Chuck (split1:06.12).</p>
                      <p>In the 100&nbsp;Metre Butterfly, &quot;Dawn&quot; swam
                      1:10.36 which was not good enough to make a final. It
                      should be noted that this is not one of her stronger
                      events.&nbsp;</p>
                      <p>In the 400 metre relay Chuck showed her class by
                      posting the 2nd fastest split of the relays 58.35 to help
                      the Squids win the gold in 4:02.10 nearly 3 seconds ahead
                      of the second placed team.
