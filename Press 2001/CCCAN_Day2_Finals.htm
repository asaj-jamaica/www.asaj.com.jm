    <p align="justify"><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 11pt">As the 
    Central American and Caribbean Swimming Championships continued at the 
    Olympic Pool, Janelle Atkinson won Jamaica’s forth medal when she placed 3rd 
    in the 18 and Over 100 M Butterfly. Swimming 1:04.70, Atkinson touched out 
    her teammate Tamara Swaby who swam a personal best time of 1:04.97.<br>
    <br>
    The finals session on day two was delayed for an hour as heavy rain, 
    lightening and thunder rocked the Santo Domingo area. While the lightning 
    abated, rain continued on and off for most of the evening session.<br>
    <br>
    In the 13-14 200 M Backstroke, Allison Bardowell was unable to improve on 
    her finals seeding, as she swam 2:40.39 to finish eight. Bardowell later 
    returned to the pool to place a credible 5th place in the 100 M Freestyle 
    with a time of 1:02.22, improving her position by two places.<br>
    <br>
    Despite swimming personal best times in the preliminary heats, Jevon 
    Atkinson swam 56.16 and Andrew Saunders 55.14 to finish 7th and 8th 
    respectively in the Male 15-16 18 and Over 100 M Freestyle. Damian Alleyne 
    won the event.<br>
    <br>
    Ramon James, who had injured his right index finger during warm-ups, swam 
    59.24 in the Male 18 and Over 100 M Butterfly placing 8th. The medical team 
    determined that James had sprained his finger after his hand had hit the 
    edge of the pool. <br>
    <br>
    Jamaica’s medal tally stands a four - 1 Gold and 3 Bronze<br>
    <br>
    The day three preliminaries begin on Thursday at 9:00 AM (8:00 AM Jamaica 
    time). Medal contenders in tomorrows events are Alia Atkinson in the 11-12 
    50 M Freestyle and Angela Chuck and Janelle Atkinson in the 18 and )ver 200 
    M Freestyle.<br>
