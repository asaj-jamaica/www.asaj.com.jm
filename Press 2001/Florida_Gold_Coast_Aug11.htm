                                On a day filled with great Jamaican swimming,
                                one Jamaican National Record and a Jamaican
                                National Age Group Record were broken at the
                                Florida Gold Coast Junior Olympics. In the 15-16
                                100 M Breaststroke, Adi&nbsp;Atkinson won the
                                Gold and broke Olympian Andrew Phillips
                                seventeen year old Jamaican National Record time
                                of 1:09.95, when he swam a fantastic 1:09.48.
                                While Adi's preliminary heats time was only
                                1:13.52, his record breaking finals swim was .5
                                second under his previous personal best and
                                15-17 National Age Group Record time of 1:09.97.
                                &nbsp;
                                <p>12 year old Alia Atkinson bettered her 11-12
                                50 M Freestyle preliminary heats time of 29.15
                                to take the Gold in 28.00, a whopping .75 of a
                                second ahead of her nearest pursuer Emily Kaser
                                of KJ Swimamerica.&nbsp;Her time shattered her
                                own Age Group Record by .23 seconds. Her time is
                                the 4th fastest 50 M Free time for a Jamaican
                                woman for the year regardless of age.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Great swims by both Atkinson's which augurs
                                well for the Carifta, CISC and hopefully CAC and
                                Commonwealth teams come 2002.</p>
                                <p>In the 400 metre Freestyle finals, Allison
                                Bardowell bettered her prelims time 4:51.69 but

                                4:47.98, just 2 seconds away from her personal
                                best. She did post a best time in the 100 metre
                                Breastroke prelims by swimming 1:25.50, beating

                                8th. Allison then lowered it again, touching 5th

                                fourth despite her leadoff effort on the
                                backstroke being out toched by Plantation Swim
                                Team, 2:09.72 to 2:10.19</p>
