            Atkinson to compete in the <a href="http://www.goodwillgames.com">Goodwill
            Games</a> swimming competition as a member of the World Allstars.
            The World Allstars team selection is based on world rankings and
            performances in recent games including the 2000 Olympics. The World
            Allstars team will be up against the best swimmers from Team USA,
            European Allstars and Team Australia when they compete in a
            round-robin format. Atkinson will join 1300 other elite athletes
            from 14 sports in major international competition August 29 to
            September 9, 2001.</p>
            <p class="news">Other stars of the pool already confirmed to compete
            in the Games include Pieter van den Hoogenband, Inge de Bruijn, Stev
            Theloke, Lars Frolander, Yana Klochkova, Martina Moravcova and

            <p class="news">The Goodwill Games swim meet will be run according
            to the American college team format, which sees the four teams swim
            against each other in a round robin format. Competing in this meet
            will give young Janelle Atkinson significant experience in
            international competition.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="news">The competition is made even more exciting with team

            This means just four swimmers, or two from each team, will be in the
            pool at any one team. Points will be accrued according to placement
            in the six preliminary sessions, with teams advancing to gold or
            bronze medal swim-offs on Monday, September 3.</p>
