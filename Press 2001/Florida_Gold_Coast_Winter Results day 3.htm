EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">Alia Atkinson today capped off a fantastic
      weekend of swimming at the Florida Gold Coast Winter Championships by
      breaking the Florida Gold Coast record in the 11-12 50 yard Breaststroke
      and added a Gold and Silver medal to her already large tally. Coming into
      the final of the Breaststroke sprint event, Atkinson had the fastest time
      by just under two (2) seconds and dominated the race to finish in 31.34,
      beating the old record of 31.49 set in 1998, more than two (2) seconds
      ahead of Tori Richmond who touched in 33.43. Atkinson’s excellent time
      put her in the Top 16 times in America for that event.</span>

      Emily Kasmer battled for the entire race. At the 50 yard turn Atkinson was
      just .03 second behind and fought hard to take the lead. In an exciting
      finish, both swimmers finished with Top 16 times, but Kasmer reached the
      wall first in 54.49, just .34 second ahead of Atkinson who finished in
      54.49.</span>
