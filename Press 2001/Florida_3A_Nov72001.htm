            November 11, 2001
            <p>On November 7, two of Jamaica's National Team Members Alia
            Atkinson and Jevon Atkinson were in action for their high school
            Flanagan winning and placing in two finals repectively. The meet was
            the Florida 3A District 9 High School Swim Championships swum in
            yards (note that the conversion for short course meters have been
            included in brackets beside the yards time).
          </div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;
            <p>First in the water for a finals was Alia with the fastest
            qualifying time of 57.51 (1:04.18) in the 100Y Freestyle. She was
            not to retain that placing in the finals as the 9th Grade Jamaican
            was beaten by her 11th Grade teamate Jenny Andreason.Going into the
            50Y turn Jenny 26.63 (29.72) held a slight advantage over Alia 26.81
            (29.92) who had improved her prelim split of 27.10 (30.24). But that
            was the end of the race as Jenny opened up the throttles and took it
            handily in 54.82 (1:01.18) over Alia 55.54 (1:01.98).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;
          </div>
          <div>
            In the Male 100Y Freestyle, Jevon Atkinson with a time of 50.52
            (56.38), 50 split 24.29 (27.10), was the top seed going into finals.
            He took the race out quickly in a first 50 time of 23.41(26.12) but
            was behind the lead qualifier Harold Ribot of Northeast who turned
            at 23.08 (25.75). In the end it was to be Jevon's race as he swam a
            last 50 sprint of 25.16(28.08) to take the title and pip Ribot 48.57
            (54.20) to 48.72(54.37).

          </div>
          <div style="width: 659; height: 124">
            Jevon's golden run unfortunately did not extend to the 100Y Backstroke.
            Despite having the second fastest time of 58.20 (1:04.95) he came
            4th in the finals clocking of 57.66(1:04.35). He was beaten into
            fourth by Omar Fathallah of South Plantation who held a small
            advantage at the 50&nbsp;and at the finish to clock 57.43 (1:04:09).
            The race winner was Jonathon Pinto was faster at each 50 than
            everyone, touching in 55.78 (1:02.25) - splits 27.11 (30.25) and
            28.67(31.99).&nbsp;

          <div>
            The last individual race for the Jamaicans was Alia who dominated in
            the 100Y Breastroke. She was the fastest qualifier and then&nbsp;showed
            her class to take the title over Gia Wright of Plantation. In
            qualifying&nbsp;Alia eased into finals with a time of&nbsp;1:13.85
            (1:22.42) split&nbsp;34.30(38.28). Her closest rival being&nbsp;Gia
            1:14.91 (1:23.60). In the final Alia stamped her authority on the
            race from the &quot;get-go&quot; taking it out in a&nbsp;quick 33.35
            (37.22) with Gia trailing badly 34.14(38.10). Gia made up some
            ground by having the faster second 50 37.98 (42.38) to Alia's 38.04
            (42.45) but it was too much to make up on the 11-12 superstar as she
            took the gold in 1:11.39 (1:19.67) to&nbsp;Gia's 1:12.12 (1:20.49).
