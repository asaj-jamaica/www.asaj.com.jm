            <p class="MsoNormal">Matthew Stewart, Alford Green and Gillian
            Stewart combined to break eight records as the Tornadoes Swim Club
            won the first ASAJ Age Group Gold Swimming Challenge held at the
            National Stadium Pool over the weekend.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">Matthew Stewart (Tornadoes Swim Club) swam a
            controlled race to break Kevin Thompson’s four year old 800 Metre
            Freestyle National Senior, 13-14 All Comers Age Group and National
            Age Group records. After posting a 1:04 for the first 100 Metres,
            Stewart swam a consistent 1:13 for the next six hundred metres.
            Turning for the final 100 metres, he had a comfortable lead and
            pulled away to touch in a record time of 9:33.41. Dave Smith
            (Tornadoes) finished second in 9:59.61.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">Y-Speedos Alford Green, swimming for the final
            time in the 9-10 Age Group, left his mark by shattering four records
            set by Tshaka Douglas (Y-Speedos) in 1990. His 100 Metre Freestyle
            swim of 1:04.41 was impressive, as Green bettered his personal best
            time by two seconds and the All Comers Age Group and National Age
            Group record time of 1:05.76 by over a second. Green also broke the
            50 Meter Freestyle All Comers Age Group and National Age Group
            records, pulling away from the field to win in a record time of
            29.40, bettering the old record of 29.46. Second was Royal Swim
            Club’s Ryan Latibeaudire (32.37).</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">Tornadoes Swim Club’s Gillian Stewart, who
            was also swimming in the 9-10 Age Group for the last time bettered
            Allison Bardowell’s 50 Metre Butterfly National Age Group Record
            set in 1997. Stewart lead for the start and when she touched in
            35.00, she was three body lengths ahead of her teammate Natasha
            Moodie (39.76) and .24 seconds ahead of the record.</p>

mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">With a number of Y-Speedos away competing in Panama,
            the Tornadoes Swim Club led the Points standings from the first
            dive. At the end of the last event, the Tornadoes had amassed 1923
            points to easily win the 2001 Age Group Gold Challenge Trophy.
            Second was the Y-Speedos (748) with the Marlins Swim Club third with
            329.</span></p>
