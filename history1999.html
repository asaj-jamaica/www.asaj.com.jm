                                    Jamaica had the privilege of hosting CARIFTA 1999 at the National Stadium Pool and by all accounts was a very successful meet. The nine (9) competing teams warmly received the exceptional effort of the Organizing Committee and volunteer group, which included persons from within and outside of the swimming community.<br>
											<br>
                                    The final standings had Jamaica wining the competition with 839.5 points ahead of a strong Bahamas team (784.5), Barbados (670), Antilles Guyane Francaise (599.5) US Virgin Islands (465.5), Cayman Islands (283) Suriname (119) Grenada (10) an St. Lucia (5). Jamaica&#x2019;s females showed great depth in winning the high point trophy in all three age groups. Allison Bardowell and Raine Paulson-Andrews dominated the 11-12 age group as Jamaican&#x2019;s won all but three events.<br>

The 13-14 female age group was much more competitive, however, three outstanding individual gold medal performances by Abiona Redwood, and individual medal performances by Amelia Thompson, Mariana Chuck and Kahlilah Robinson pulled off a 18.5 point victory over the US Virgin Islands.

In the 11-12 age group, Dominic Lee shone as he won silver in both Breaststroke events as well as the 200 M Individual Medley. The 13-14 age group belonged to Chris Vythoulkas won the hearts of the girls as well as eight gold medals.<br>

He took the bronze in the 100 M and 200 M Freestyle and then teamed up with Jason James, Adi Atkinson and Timothy Wong the take the silver in the 200 M Freestyle relay and bronze in the 400 M Medley Relay. Jeremy Knowles of the Bahamas, dominated the 15-17 age group as he entered and won thirteen (13) events, breaking four (4) meet events in the process.<br>

                                    Jamaica&#x2019;s team of twelve (12) swimmers performed credibly under difficult circumstances at the CCCAN Swimming Championships held in Medillin, Columbia. The team was managed by Locksley Todd and Coached by Nathan Brown and Michael Wilson. The Team Doctor was Dr. Dutris Bourne. The high altitude, security concerns and psychological factors probably due to insufficient preparation prior to leaving Jamaica seemed to affect the team performance. The new Council will have to ensure that Team Managers and Coaches are selected well in advance of the competition so that the best conditions can be ensured for our swimmers.<br>
											<br>
                                    Abiona Redwood swam 28.20 to take the Silver medal in the 50 M Freestyle while Allison Bardowell won the bronze medal in the 200 M Backstroke in a time of 2:36.86. Most swimmers achieved personal best times in at least one event while seven (7) swimmers made at least one final. There were inspiring performances by Paul Peat and Ramon James, who despite not medalling in their events, showed grit, determination and commitment throughout the entire competition. All teams need such leadership from their senior members.<br>

Special mention must be made of Bolles School Assistant Coach Rick Bishop who worked very closely with the Jamaican Team. His experience at major competitions provided a wealth of knowledge and guidance for the team.<br>
											<br>
                                    Janelle Atkinson&#x2019;s silver medal performance in the 200 M, 400 M and 800 M Freestyle events was no doubt the highlight of the Games for Jamaica. Her swims, most of which where world ranked in the top ten, attracted a lot of attention and have put Jamaica on the world-swimming map. Janelle was asked to carry the Jamaican flag at the Games closing ceremonies.<br>
											<br>
										</font></p>
									<p><font size="1" face="Verdana">Angela Chuck and Tamara Swaby swam best or near best times and the experience gained will no doubt help them as they train to qualify for the 2000 Olympic Games Team. Jilandre Atkinson preformed well below her best due to difficulties in her training program leading up to the Games.<br>

                                    Jamaica&#x2019;s first Synchronized Swimming Club was registered in 1999. The Club, led by Coach Katherine LimSang is currently the driving force behind the development of Synchronized Swimming in Jamaica. Worldwide, the sport still does not enjoy mass participation and it is anticipated that its development in Jamaica will require dedication and patience. 1999 saw the number of swimmers participating in the Clubs program double to approximately 30 persons. Our first goal for International Competition is CISC 2000 to be held in Aruba where Jamaica&#x2019;s participation is eagerly awaited by the Caribbean Synchronized Swimming Community.<br>
											<br>
                                    Until a formal Development Program has been developed Council has adopted the Canadian Star Program as the standard for teaching and awarding swimmers.<br>
											<br>
                                    In April, Mrs. Sandra Roberts Honorary Secretary of the FINA Technical Synchronized Swimming Committee, conducted a Judges Clinic for twenty five (25) persons. Twenty one (21) completed the course and received participation certificates. To prepare the participants for the clinic, Coach Katherine LimSang and Kathy Morgan conducted a judges workshop prior to Mrs. Roberts arrival. Already, a number of the judges have gained practical experience judging the figures and routines of the Star Program.<br>

											</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana" color="blue"><b>National Team </b><b><br>
											</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana">The need to develop a program for the development of our National Team became increasingly obvious as more of our elite swimmers migrated or left the island to attend college. Additionally, the elite swimmers who remain in Jamaica have fewer training partners making motivation for serious training difficult. The ASAJ Council has approved a National Team Program that calls for the appointment of two National Coaches, establishes a baseline for a swimmers training through the National Training Model, a schedule of clinics, swim camps and participation international competition. Our first goal is to qualify and prepare swimmers for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.<br>
											<br>
										</font><font size="1" face="Verdana">Two squads, a National and Junior National Squad will be selected as soon as the Coaches have been appointed. Copies of the National Team Development Program are available at the ASAJ Office.<br>
										</font></p>
									<p><font size="1" face="Verdana" color="blue"><b>Coaches Development</b><b><br>
											</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana">Coaches development continues to be a priority with new developments and approaches being implemented in 1999. To foster greater interaction and knowledge transfer amongst local coaches a series of Coaches Workshops were scheduled the first of which was held in October.<br>
											<br>
                                    The 1999 Coaches Clinic was held in December The clinic is was sponsored by Olympic Solidarity funding and was divided into two (2) sections. The first section, held in Montego Bay was conducted by Mr. Guy Edson, President of ASCA and will cover portions of the ASCA Level 1,2 and 3 Coaches School. The second section, held in Kingston, targeted the more experienced coaches and focus on coaching long distance swimmers. The Instructor was Coach Michael Curley.<br>
											<br>
                                    After extensive discussions, Council determined that there is a need to develop a coaches certification program. A Committee of three, Mrs. Barbara Briggs, Coach Jackie Walter and Coach Nathan Brown, was commissioned to evaluated a number of existing systems (including establishing our own)and concluded that the American Swim Coaches Association&#x2019;s (ASCA) System would benefit our coaches the most. Discussions are continuing with ASCA President Mr. Guy Edson and as soon as agreement is reached the program will be implemented. Our target date is early 2000.<br>

                                    The Sports Development Foundation&#x2019;s (SDF) grant of one JA$1 million for the calendar year 1999 provided the ASAJ with the ability to better plan and introduce it&#x2019;s development plan. This grant together with careful expenditure control has allowed us to remain solvent. The SDF has also provided significant assistance to Janelle Atkinson and I should not miss this opportunity to thank the SDF for their continued support.<br>
											<br>
                                    Except for the Junior Championships, the ASAJ managed to recover all meet expenses through sponsorships, gate receipts, entry fees, program advertisements and other sales.<br>
											<br>
                                    Securing sponsorship continues to be difficult in these challenging economic times. Mayberry Investments and Nestle Ja. Ltd. provided significant sponsorship for school meets while there were a number of other smaller contributors, for all of which the swimming community is grateful.<br>
